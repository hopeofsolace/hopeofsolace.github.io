# Retro Notes
In Agile programming (as opposed to big up front design) methodologies you have an itteration that lasts a week or two. You have some work you plan on doing during the iteration. Usually the work would be broken into user stories (e.g. "the user can attack a monster by clicking a button").

At the end of an iteration the team would have a retrospective where they talk about the team's process and how feel about how the iteration went. 

## 8/31
(good) :)
* having an overall project
  * motivation
  * easy to come up with new feature

(bad) :(
* making something real (not like a toy or tutorial) requires more skill
  * as you make a bigger piece of software each feature gets harder to add
* haven't spent enough time on basics, like syntax of the language
  * these are a necessary foundation
* hank driving too much (not enough Phillip questions)
* did some refactoring last time but it was too advanced for right now
* Hank underestimated how long it takes to get a handle on core programming ideas

(action) !
* do some smaller excercises/puzzles/problems that can be done with less code in a shorter time
* more repetition of ideas, more practice
* we probably need all of the core ideas under our belt before we do a totally open ended project
* Phillip ask questions ASAP
